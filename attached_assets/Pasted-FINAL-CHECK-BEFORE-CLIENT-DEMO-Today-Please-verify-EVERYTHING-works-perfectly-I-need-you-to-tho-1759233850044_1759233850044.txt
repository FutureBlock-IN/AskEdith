FINAL CHECK BEFORE CLIENT DEMO Today - Please verify EVERYTHING works perfectly

I need you to thoroughly test and fix ALL issues in this application before tomorrow's demo:

## 1. CLERK AUTHENTICATION
- Check Clerk integration is working properly
- User login should be fast (no delays)
- User profile image should load quickly after login
- Verify authentication tokens are handled correctly
- Test login/logout flow multiple times
- NO authentication errors in console

## 2. ADMIN APPROVAL & BADGES
CRITICAL ISSUE: When admin approves an expert:
- Badge should update to "Verified Expert" IMMEDIATELY
- Should NOT require page refresh
- Should NOT show "Waiting for Approval" after approval
- Real-time update when approval happens
- Test this flow completely and fix any delays

## 3. PERFORMANCE ISSUES - MUST FIX
PROBLEM: Pages loading very slowly, taking too long:

**Expert Profile View Page:**
- Currently takes too long to load expert data
- Should load FAST (under 2 seconds)
- Optimize database queries
- Add loading states but make them quick
- Fix any slow API calls

**User Profile Image:**
- Sometimes takes too long to show user profile picture
- Should load immediately after login
- Optimize image loading
- Add image caching
- Use proper image optimization

**All Pages:**
- Check EVERY page loads fast
- No buffering/stuck loading spinners
- Smooth navigation between pages
- No lag when clicking to navigate

## 4. CONSOLE ERRORS - ZERO TOLERANCE
- Check browser console on EVERY page
- Fix ALL errors (red errors in console)
- Fix ALL warnings if possible
- No 401 unauthorized errors on public pages
- No missing image/resource errors
- Clean console = professional app

## 5. NAVIGATION & USER EXPERIENCE
