IV. Technical Considerations & Recommendations

New App Creation Strategy

New App Creation: Start a completely new Lovable app to ensure zero risk to the existing communication hub
Code Access Limitations: The current app's core files are read-only protected
Design Inheritance: New app AI should analyze existing app's code for styling, artistic, and feeling purposes

Create what you can and we can iterate from here.
