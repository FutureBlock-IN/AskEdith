FEATURE REQUEST: Add appointment booking functionality for verified experts

CURRENT FLOW:
- User signs up → completes profile
- If user checks "I'm a healthcare/elder professional" → expert form opens
- Expert fills form and waits for admin approval

NEW REQUIREMENT:

Add a new checkbox in the expert form:
☐ Allow appointment booking after verification

FUNCTIONALITY:

1. Expert Form Addition
   - Add checkbox: "Allow appointment booking after verification"
   - This checkbox appears only in the expert signup form
   - Expert can check this during profile completion

2. Conditional Display Logic
   - If expert checks the box AND admin approves expert
   - Show "Book Appointment" button on expert's profile page
   - If not checked or not approved → hide booking button

3. Calendly Integration for Scheduling
   - When "Book Appointment" button is clicked
   - Open Calendly scheduling interface
   - Expert needs to set up their Calendly account separately
   - Store expert's Calendly link in database

4. Expert Availability Setup
   - Expert provides their Calendly link during form completion
   - Add field: "Calendly Link" (text input)
   - This link will be used to embed Calendly widget

5. Database Changes
   - First check if these columns already exist in the database
   - If not exists, add column: allow_booking (boolean, default false)
   - If not exists, add column: calendly_link (text, nullable)
   - Both fields saved when expert completes form

6. Book Appointment Flow
   User clicks "Book Appointment" → Opens Calendly embed → User selects date/time → Booking confirmed through Calendly

Please implement:
- Checkbox in expert form for appointment booking
- Calendly link input field
- Check database for existing columns before adding new ones
- Conditional "Book Appointment" button display
- Calendly widget integration on click

Note: Experts will manage their availability (month, dates, times, hours) directly in their Calendly account, not in our application.
