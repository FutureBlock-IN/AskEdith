I need to fix the following critical bugs before tomorrow's client demo:

## BUG 1: Expert Hourly Rate Not Saving
- ISSUE: When I signup as an expert and set hourly rate to $300 in onboarding, it shows default rate $100 instead
- EXPECTED: Display the hourly rate ($300) that I set during onboarding
- CURRENT: Always showing $100 as default rate
- FIX NEEDED: Save and display the correct hourly rate from onboarding

## BUG 2: Expert Profile Page Shows "Not Found"
- ISSUE: After completing profile, when I click "View Profile" button on experts page, getting "Not Found" error
- EXPECTED: Show expert profile details (without booking button until admin approves)
- CURRENT: "Not Found" error page
- FIX NEEDED: 
  * Show expert profile details immediately after profile completion
  * Hide "Book Appointment" button until admin approval
  * Show "Book Appointment" button only after admin approves the profile
  * Customers should be able to VIEW profile before approval, just can't book

## BUG 3: Approval Badge Not Updating in Real-time
- ISSUE: After admin approves my profile, experts page still shows "Waiting for Approval" badge. Only shows "Verified Expert" after browser refresh
- EXPECTED: Badge should update to "Verified Expert" immediately when admin approves
- CURRENT: Requires manual browser refresh to see "Verified Expert" badge
- FIX NEEDED: Update badge in real-time without page refresh when admin approves

## BUG 4: Performance Issues and Loading Problems
- ISSUE: Multiple pages are loading slowly with buffering/loading spinners
- SPECIFIC PROBLEMS:
  * Expert pages taking too long to load
  * Other pages also loading slowly
  * Sometimes clicking pages shows loading/buffering indefinitely
- FIX NEEDED:
  * Check browser console for errors and fix them
  * Optimize page loading performance
  * Check database queries for optimization
  * Review all pages for performance bottlenecks
  * Test all navigation flows

## URGENT REQUEST:
Please thoroughly check the ENTIRE application for:
- Any other bugs or errors
- Console errors in browser logs
- Server errors in backend logs
- Slow loading pages
- Broken navigation or links
- Data not saving correctly
- UI/UX issues

**DEADLINE: Tomorrow is client demo - all issues must be fixed today**

I have attached screenshots showing these issues. Please prioritize these bugs and ensure the application is stable and performant for tomorrow's demo.
