CRITICAL BUG: Application completely broken with infinite 401 errors and Supabase connection failures

ENVIRONMENT:
- Downloaded project as ZIP from Replit
- Running locally in VS Code on port 5000
- Using Clerk authentication
- Same issues occur on both local AND live Replit URL

IMPORTANT: I am NOT logged in - just trying to browse public pages, but the app is completely broken

CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. Infinite 401 Loop Breaking Everything
   - Console shows hundreds of "GET http://localhost:5000/api/user 401 (Unauthorized)" errors repeating endlessly
   - I am NOT logged in, just clicking on pages to view them
   - The app should allow browsing public pages without authentication
   - Instead, it tries to fetch user data infinitely even when no user is logged in
   - This infinite loop causes browser to freeze
   - All pages stuck on loading/buffering screen forever
   - Cannot access ANY pages: Expert page, Dashboard, Community page - all broken
   - Even without logging in, the app continuously retries failed requests

2. Supabase Image Loading Failure
   - Error: "GET https://tvesaresdbghbtocwpdj.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/expert-files/... net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED"
   - Images cannot load from Supabase storage
   - DNS resolution failing for Supabase URLs

3. Complete Application Failure
   - No pages render, just infinite loading
   - Browser performance degraded due to endless API calls
   - Application completely unusable
   - Refresh doesn't help - same infinite loop starts again
   - Cannot even view public pages as a non-logged-in user

ROOT CAUSES TO FIX:

1. React Query Infinite Retry Loop
   - /api/user endpoint being called infinitely even when user is not logged in
   - App should NOT call /api/user for unauthenticated users browsing public pages
   - Need to add: retry: false to all useQuery configurations
   - Need to add: enabled: !!clerkUser condition to prevent calls without authentication
   - Add proper error handling for 401 responses
   - Allow public pages to render without requiring user data

2. please check if Clerk Integration Broken
   - Backend /api/user endpoint not receiving or verifying Clerk tokens
   - Frontend calling /api/user even when no Clerk session exists
   - Need to check if Clerk user exists BEFORE making API calls
   - Frontend not including Clerk authentication token in API headers
   - Need to use Clerk's getToken() and include in Authorization header

3. Supabase Configuration Issue
   - Supabase URL not resolving - check environment variables
   - May need to update Supabase project URL or check if project is active

IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:

Fix the infinite retry loop for unauthenticated users:
```javascript
// In all React Query useQuery calls:
const { user: clerkUser, isLoaded } = useUser();

useQuery({
  queryKey: ['user'],
  queryFn: fetchUser,
  retry: false, // CRITICAL: Stop infinite retries
  enabled: isLoaded && !!clerkUser, // Only fetch when Clerk user exists
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  onError: (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Stop retrying on auth errors
      return;
    }
  }
})
